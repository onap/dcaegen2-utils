       Build the specified packages. 'package-type' is one or more of  docker,
       debian, (comma-separated), or 'all' to build all of them.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       -h, --help          show a help message and exit

       -n, --skipexecution indicate the packages and exit

       -c, --usecache      if a debian/tar/tgz artifact already exists use it

       -N, --skipbuild     skip actually building the packages

       -K, --keeptempfiles keep temp files at exit

       -v, --verbose       turn on verbosity

       -b PACKAGETYPE, --packagetype PACKAGETYPE
                           The package-type may be specified multiple times or
                           may use a ','-separated  or  space-separated  list.
                           'all'  is an alias for all of them.  Potential val‐
                           ues are debian, docker, tar or tgz

       -u, --upload        Depending on package type -- docker, debian, tar or
                           tgz -- uploads the artifact to a remote repository.
                           For Docker,  uses  $DOCKERREGISTRY  as  the  remote
                           repository  to  push  the  image.  For Debian, uses
                           $REPACKAGEDEBIANUPLOAD as the command, with {0}  as
                           the  local  path  to  the  debian image, {1} as the
                           image name with build number, and optionally {2} as
                           groupId  (may  be  used  as  part  of the directory
                           path), {3} as the image name without the build num‐
                           ber, and {4} as the image name with no build number
                           and no .deb suffix.  For additional  uploads,  this
                           will   also   look   for   $REPACKAGEDEBIANUPLOAD2,
                           $REPACKAGEDEBIANUPLOAD3,  etc.,  and   repeat   the
                           upload.  For  tar,  uses $REPACKAGETARUPLOAD as the
                           command. Everything said  about  $REPACKAGEDEBIANU‐
                           PLOAD applies to $REPACKAGETARUPLOAD. For tgz, uses
                           $REPACKAGETGZUPLOAD as the command. Everything said
                           about  $REPACKAGEDEBIANUPLOAD  applies  to $REPACK‐
                           AGETGZUPLOAD.  In addition, if --multipleuploadver‐
                           sions is used, the above will be executed using the
                           list of upload  version  numbers  specified  there.
                           This  is typically used to create multiple versions
                           (using --multipleuploadversions) on multiple remote
                           repositories (using $REPACKAGE*UPLOAD).

       -d DIRECTORY, --directory DIRECTORY
                           where  to  find  the  stage  directory  and repack‐
                           age.yaml.  Defaults to '.'

       -e ENVIRONFILE, --environfile ENVIRONFILE
                           Optional environment file. Overrides  $REPACKAGEEN‐
                           VFILE, defaults to /dev/null

       -o OUTPUTDIRECTORY, --outputdirectory OUTPUTDIRECTORY
                           Output   directory.   Defaults  to  'output'  under
                           --directory path.

       -y FILE, --repackageyaml FILE
                           Name  of  parameter  file.  Defaults  to   'repack‐
                           age.yaml'  or  'repackage.json'  under  --directory
                           path.

       -B buildnumber, --buildnumber BUILD-NUMBER
                           Build  number.  Defaults  to  $BUILD_NUMBER,  which
                           defaults to a date-based string.

       -M  MULTIPLEUPLOADVERSIONS, --multipleuploadversions MULTIPLEUPLOADVER‐
       SIONS
                           Use multiple versions for  upload.  Comma-separated
                           list  of  {datetime},  {buildnumber}  or  arbitrary
                           strings.  Defaults to {buildnumber}, which  is  the
                           value from --buildnumber.

       Repackage requires as its input four items:

       stage/*             A  directory  structure  filled with files laid out
                           exactly as they are to appear on the end system, as
                           if  "stage"  were  the  root of the filesystem. For
                           DCAE applications, it is recommended that  you  use
                           the  path opt/app/PACKAGENAME for all files associ‐
                           ated with PACKAGENAME.

       repackage.yaml or repackage.json
                           A configuration file  with  information  about  the
                           packages,  such  as  the  package's  name,  version
                           information, dependencies,  etc.  More  information
                           will be provided below.

       Dockerfile          This  file is only used for creating Docker images.
                           It contains the docker creation script.

       common/*            If needed,  any  package  installation  or  package
                           removal  scripts would be placed here. They must be
                           named preinst, postinst, prerm or postrm.

       If the installation scripts need some temporary  files,  it  is  recom‐
       mended  that  you  place  them into stage/opt/app/PACKAGENAME/pkg. Your
       installation script can then remove that directory if  necessary  after
       successful installation.
